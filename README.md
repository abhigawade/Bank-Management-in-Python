# Bank-Management-in-Python
This is my basic console-based python project on Bank Management. In which i have used the python concepts like oops, functions, list, loops, conditional statements and some basic concepts. In this project I have added basic functionalities like register, login, money deposit, withdraw, transfer and view details.
